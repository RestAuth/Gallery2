=== ABOUT ===
This is a plugin for Gallery2 [1] that integrates it into the RestAuth shared
authentication framework. For the plugin to work, it requires Gallery2 to be
patched (see INSTALLATION). So far, the plugin only uses the most basic features
of RestAuth, that is, it only authenticates users against a RestAuth server. No
settings, groups, etc. are synchronized.

=== INSTALLATION ===
Generic installation instructions for installing a Gallery2 module can be found
here:
	http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:User_Contributions#Modules

This module requires php-restauth[1] to be installed and in the path of your
system.

Additionally, this module requires a patch for Gallery2 for it to work. The
patches/ directory includes two patches, you can only use one of them:

* verification:
  Only verify existing user-accounts, you have to have a local account in order
  to use your RestAuth password.
* autocreate:
  Automatically creates a local user if the user does not yet exist locally. The
  downside is that the patch is more invasive which increases the chance that it
  somehow breaks Gallery2 in subtle ways.

I guess most users will want to use the autocreate patch. To apply either patch,
go to your gallery2 directory and execute:
	patch < *path-to-patch*

=== HOW TO USE ===
The plugin requires configuration in the RestAuth page. The settings are fairly
straight-forward and described on that page.
